We don’t like it when someone says he or she is unavailable. Do we? That’s why we make ourselves available, to all, all the time. But we should not. 

With the internet and social media, where you can reach to anyone within a matter of seconds, it becomes a habit, to feel the urge to be connected, to respond to every message, check every notification, be everywhere, FOMO basically. 

And when you do that, you let people know that you are available all the time, whenever they gonna send something our way, we will leave anything that we might be working on to check those messages/memes. 

It’s not gonna help you. Make yourself unavailable, if people on the other side need you, they’ll call, or call the nearest person to you. 

Few ways: 
1. Occupy yourself doing what you love, not looking at others doing what they love 
2. Turn off notifications, all of them, except calls 
3. Set downtime for your device
