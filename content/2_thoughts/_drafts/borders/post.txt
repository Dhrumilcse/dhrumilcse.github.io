Title: Borders

I recently got rejected from an opportunity just because I live in a different country (though not more than 5km away) from the origin of the company. They were in an early stage and were not able to afford my relocation expenses. While the construction of the borders upset me a little, I support their decision. 

On the contrary, with ongoing riots and abuse of power in one country, my being just 5 km away in a different country makes me feel extremely safe. 

The only difference? Borders. Boundaries we establish and fight over.
