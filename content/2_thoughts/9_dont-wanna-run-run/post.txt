I wouldn’t say running is my favorite thing to do. Even so, I try to run every now and then. The problem is consistency.

Whenever I take a long break from running, it becomes harder to get started again, and it happens more often than I'd like to admit. Today was one of those days. Luckily, guided runs on [Nike Run Club](https://www.nike.com/ca/nrc-app) have been a great companion ever since I started running. It makes it a bit easier to show up and get going. And surprisingly, it's free.

I went for the *'I don’t wanna run, run'*, and it felt good.
