Starring at the moon through my bedroom window made me wonder about _another life_. Out of a billion galaxies, there are chances that at least one of them is sustaining living beings. Or at least, I believe it to be true. It got me thinking:
- What would our first encounter with them look like? 
- What would _they_ look like?
- Would they be far ahead and more advanced than we are? Or are we the earliest and smartest amongst them all?
- Would they have a language of some sort? A concept of time? Or perhaps someone to rule their planet?
