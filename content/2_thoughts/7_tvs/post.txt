What are the first 3 words that come to mind when you think about living rooms? 
TV? 100%. 
Couch? Of course. 
Carpet? Sure. 
Plants? Maybe.

Why did we normalize having TVs as the center of attraction in the living rooms? Of course, designer-led houses might not follow the same pattern, or maybe they are better at framing or hiding them. But, all the houses of lower to upper middle class have their furniture pointed to their TVs, or at least those that Iâ€™ve had a chance to see. 

With the emergence of AI-integrated devices, I wonder what would be an ideal replacement candidate for the TVs?

I should try convincing my partner to remove the TV from our living room and replace it with wall art, at least for a week.
